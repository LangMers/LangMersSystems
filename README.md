# Immersive Language Learning System

The Immersive Language Learning System is a language learning method designed to provide an immersive language learning experience for users. The system uses scannable physical visual aids, such as stickers or note cards, which display different words in the language to be learned. These visual aids are attached to real-world objects in the user's environment.

## Features

- Scannable Visual Aids: The system includes a set of visual aids that can be scanned using a mobile device equipped with an imaging device, such as a smartphone camera. These visual aids display words in the target language and are attached to corresponding real-world objects.

- Software Application: The system includes a software application that runs on the mobile device. This application is configured to read the coded information on each visual aid through the device's camera and provide the user with information to facilitate learning of the word displayed on the visual aid.

- Prompt and Scan Game: The software application includes a game mode called "Prompt and Scan." In this game, the user is provided with an audible pronunciation of a word on a visual aid and prompted to scan the visual aid that displays the spoken word. This game mode helps reinforce word recognition and pronunciation.

- Geolocation Game: The software application also includes a game mode called "Geolocation." In this game, the user is presented with visual aids attached to different real-world objects in the user's environment. If the user correctly scans a visual aid in response to being presented with a given word, the application records the coordinates of the visual aid and the object it is attached to. Subsequent plays of the game will guide the user to the correct object using geolocation cues.

- Audio Feedback and Pronunciation Improvement: The software application allows the user to provide audio input in the form of spoken words. The application uses this audio input to evaluate and improve the user's pronunciation of the spoken word.

- Additional Application Functions: The software application includes various additional functions, such as providing information on word usage in phrases or sentences, presenting visual representations of words, directing the user to websites or webpages for additional information, and offering a choice between immersion mode and game mode.

## Technical Specifications

- Hardware: The system requires a mobile device equipped with an imaging device, such as a smartphone with a camera.

- Software: The system includes a software application that runs on the mobile device. The application is compatible with popular mobile operating systems.

- Visual Aids: The system includes a set of scannable physical visual aids, such as stickers or note cards. These visual aids display words in the target language and are attached to real-world objects.

## Usage Instructions

1. Attach the scannable visual aids to real-world objects in your environment. Each visual aid displays a word in the target language.

2. Launch the software application on your mobile device.

3. Use the camera of your mobile device to scan the visual aids. The application will read the coded information on each visual aid and provide you with information and feedback to facilitate learning of the displayed word.

4. Explore the different modes and features of the application, such as the Prompt and Scan game and the Geolocation game. These games help reinforce word recognition and pronunciation.

5. Use the audio feedback and pronunciation improvement features to enhance your language learning experience.

6. Customize your learning experience by selecting different visual aids, themes, and game modes within the application.

7. Track your progress and performance through game scores and statistics provided by the application.

8. Update the application and access additional features, materials, or resources as they become available.
